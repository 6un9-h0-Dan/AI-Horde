# KoboldAI-cluster

Turns KoboldAI into a giant crowdsourced distributed cluster

# Generating Prompts

To request the generation for a prompt, you need to send a post request like so:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt":"I entered into an argument with a clown", "params":{"max_length":16, "frmttriminc": true, "n":2}, "username":"db0", "models":["KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B-Nerys-v2"]}' http://dbzer0.com:5001/generate/prompt
```

The "params" dictionary is the same as the parameters you pass to the KoboldAI API in the `api/latest/generate endpoint`, the only difference is that the "prompt" is outside the "params" dictionary.

With one important difference, the "Gens per action" param `n` can be as high as you want! Each server will only handle 1 at a time, but multiple server will be able to work on your request at the same time.

Pass a username in order to track your usage. Proper authentication will come later.

Pass the desired model names in the "model" arg to allow only KAIs running one of those models to fulfil your request. If you skip the "models" arg, all KAI instances will be able to generate for you, but of course the result will vary per model.

The `max_length` and `max_content_length` params that you pass are your wish. If the KAI server checking your request has a lower limit, they will skip all generation requests with a higher wish

Once run, This request will return a UUID

```
{"id": "34a9f91a-6db5-4d4c-962f-c4d795739610"}
```

You can now request the status of this prompt using this UUID from the server

```
curl dbzer0.com:5001/generate/prompt/2a72f411-a4c3-49e1-aad4-41005e1ff769
{"finished": 1, "processing": 0, "waiting": 1, "done": false, "generations": [" as he stood before me."]}
```

Once the `finished` arg is equal to your `n`, then your request is completed.

# Using KoboldAI client

The United branch of KoboldAI now supports using the bridge directly from its interface. To do so, you will need to start it with special variables (as the GUI has not been updated yet)

If you're using the `play.(sh|bat)` file, then pass the arguments to staryt a KAI instance in cluster mode like so (Change "Anonynous" to your own username of course)

UNIX

```bash
USERNAME=Anonymous
play.sh --path http://dbzer0.com:5001 --model CLUSTER --apikey ${USERNAME}
```

WINDOWS


```bash
play.bat --path http://dbzer0.com:5001 --model CLUSTER --apikey Anonymous
```

This will use any available model on the cluster. If you want to use only specific models, pass the wanted modules via one or more `req_model` args. Example `--req_model "KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B-Nerys-v2" --req_model "KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-2.7B-Nerys"`

Once the KAI starts in cluster mode, any request will be sent to the cluster

# Joining the cluster

This repository comes with a little bridge script which you can run on your own machine (windows or linux). It will take care of communicating between KAI cluster server and your own KAI. This will allow people to use their own PCs to support the KAI cluster.

**You KoboldAI instance must be using the UNITED branch!**

* First clone this repo and then open a terminal/console and `cd` into it
* Make sure you have python3 installed
* install the requirements with pip: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user`
* Edit the clientData.py file and add your own username and password. The password is stored in plaintext for now, so don't reuse an existing one.
* Edit the clientData.py file and add your KAI server. If it's a local instance, leave it as it is. If it's a remote instance, fill in the URL and port accordingly.
* Modify your KAI settings from the GUI so that the "Amount to Generate" and "Typical Sampling" are at the max values your KAI instance can handle. This doesn't mean all requests will use this amount. It just limits which requests your server will choose to fulfil.
* Softprompts don't hurt, but at this point they are not taken into account, so you will mess with people's expectation on what you generate. I suggest you put softprompt to none for now.
* Finally, run the script: `python bridge.py`
   * Optionally, provide bridge arguments via command line. The args on the command line will override clientData.py vars, so you can use this to run multiple bridges from the same location. See `python bridge.py -h`

If all goes well, it will connect to your KAI instance and then will start polling the cluster for incoming requests.

A server will be considered "stale" and not shown in the general list, if it doesn't check in for at least 5 minutes. You can see still them through their individual UUID endpoint, and it will continue where it left off as soon as it checks back in to fulfil requests. In fact, it doesn't technically need to be the same server. You can switch to a different box and long as your server name and auth is the same, your stats will carry on. This means that you can keep plugging in different collab instances while retaining the same stats.


## Other endpoints

* GET `/servers` To see the info of all currently active servers and their statistics.
   ```json
   [{"name": "Db0's Awesome Instance", "id": "019e34e3-3109-4ea9-820a-b0c4f6a53c07", "model": "KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-2.7B-Nerys", "max_length": 80, "max_content_length": 1632, "tokens_generated": 30, "requests_fulfilled": 2, "latest_performance": "1.36 seconds per token"}]
* GET `/servers/<UUID>` To see the information of a specific server by UUID.
* GET `/usage` to see how much each user has consumed this service.
* GET `/contributions` to see how much each user has contributed to this service with their own resources.
* GET `/models` Which models are currently active and how many servers are running each

## Other Info

The cluster does not save any prompts nor generations locally. It's all stored in memory. Furthermore, requested prompts and their generations are wiped after 10 minutes of inactivity

The bridge also does not save any prompts, but of course this is not under my control as the bridges run locally on the various cluster nodes. As such, you should not prompt with anything you do not want others to see!

This system stores how many tokens you requested to generate, and how many your own servers have generated for others. This is not used yet, but eventually this will be how we balance resources among the users.

## Advanced Usage Local and Cluster KAI

If you want to both play with KAI AND share resources with the community, you can achieve this by running two instances of KAI side by side. One normal one, and one in cluster mode. That way when you're using the clustered KAI, you will ensure there's always at least one instance to serve you (your own), while also taking advantage of any other instances that are onboarded at the time.

1. start KAI as you would normally do with `play.(sh|bat)` and load the model you want.
2. open a terminal window at your KAI installation, and now run `play.(sh|bat)` using a different port in CLUSTER mode. This will start open another KAI window, while leaving your model-loaded KAI intact. Make sure the `req_model` you pass, includes the model loaded in your own KAI instance.

```bash
play.bat --port 5002 --path http://dbzer0.com:5001 --model CLUSTER --apikey Anonymous --req_model "KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-13B-Nerys-v2" --req_model "KoboldAI/fairseq-dense-2.7B-Nerys"
```

Now use the CLUSTER KAI to play. You will see the requests being fulfilled by the model-loaded KAI after you press the button.
