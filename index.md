# Stable Horde

<img style="float:right" src="https://github.com/db0/KoboldAI-Horde/blob/master/img/{kobold_image}.jpg?raw=true" width="300" /> This is a crowdsourced distributed cluster of [Stable Diffusion generators](https://github.com/db0/stable-diffusion-webui). If you like this service, consider joining the horde yourself!

## Stats 

* Average Recent Performance: {avg_performance} pixels per second
* Total pixels generated: {total_pixels}
* Total requests fulfilled: {total_fulfillments}
* Active [Servers](/api/v1/servers): {active_servers}
* Current Request Queue: {total_queue}

## Usage

1. [Register an account](/register) which will generate for you an API key. Store that key somewhere.     
    * if you do not want to register, you can use '0000000000' as api_key to connect anonymously. However anonymous accounts have the lowest priority when there's too many concurrent requests!
    * To increase your priority you will need a unique API key and then to increase your Kudos. [Read how Kudos are working](https://dbzer0.com/blog/the-kudos-based-economy-for-the-koboldai-horde/).
